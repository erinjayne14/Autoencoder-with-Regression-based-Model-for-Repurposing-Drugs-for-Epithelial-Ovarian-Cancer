# Autoencoder-with-Regression-based-Model-for-Repurposing-Drugs-for-Epithelial-Ovarian-Cancer
This is the repository that contains all the codes and files used in the thesis entitled "Autoencoder with Regression-based Model for Repurposing Drugs for Epithelial Ovarian Cancer" by Agraviador, Evangelista, and Trinidad.

How to run this VAE Regression Model:
1.  Create a Google account to run the files in Google Colab.
2.  Download the model to be run entitled "Variational Regression Model.ipynb"
3.  Open the model file in Google Colab.
5.  Make sure to download all the necessary files to be run in the model found in the folder "Input Files".
6.  Upload the input files in the the model file after opening it in Google Colab.
7.  Run the codes.
8.  After running the codes, the predicted compounds with pIC50 can be retrieved downloaded as csv.
